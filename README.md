# GWC Website Template

Use this template as a starter for your own website!

`index.html` is your homepage; add your HTML content there. Add your own custom styles to `css/styles.css` and your own custom JavaScript to `js/app.js`.

The CSS and JS files are already linked to the `index.html` file. All you need to do is start a server on your localhost and open the page in your browser.

For Mac and Windows, [Fenix] provides an easy way to create a development environment for static websites.
